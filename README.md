QMLGalaxyPortal
===============

A quick and easy way to check the status of biomedical research on Galaxy and review your history.

# Features

Browse your histories in a friendly format for small screen touch devices. Quickly see if a job is still running, has errors, is completed or a number of other possible statuses from colour coding, or by clicking on an item to flip it over and view status and other content data (data retrieved can be customised in the app settings).

Use the magnifier glass to zoom in and retrieve additional details and take a peek at the results, and zoom in even further to take a closer look at any data field.

# Development
